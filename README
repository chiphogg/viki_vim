This plugin adds wiki-like hypertext capabilities to Vim. You can use viki as 
a "minor" mode (i.e., as an add-on to any other mode) or as a full-fledged 
wiki mode. There is also an add-on plugin for "wikifying" latex documents by 
turning some latex commands into wiki names. If viki is properly configured, 
activating a reference to an image, a webpage etc. will view that resource in 
an external viewer.

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/deplate/ you can download a ruby based 
tool to convert viki markup to LaTeX, HTML, or DocBook. On its homepage 
(http://deplate.sf.net) you can read a more detailled specification of the 
markup.
